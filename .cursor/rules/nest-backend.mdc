# NestJS Backend Standards
- Use DTOs with `class-validator` for all inputs.
- Keep controllers thin; put logic in services.
- Use dependency injection; avoid static helpers.
- Enforce auth/roles with guards and decorators.
- Log errors with context; never expose secrets.
- Prefer Prisma/TypeORM transactions for multi-write flows.

## Endpoint Pattern
```text
Controller -> Service -> Repository/DB
```
