# Core Code Quality
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever code.
- Use small functions with single responsibility.
- Name variables and functions by intent, not type.
- Validate inputs at boundaries; never trust external data.
- Handle errors explicitly; never swallow exceptions.
- Add brief comments only where logic is non-obvious.
- Keep files focused; split large files into modules.

## Example
```text
Bad: doStuff(a, b)
Good: calculateCourseScore(userProgress, courseStats)
```
