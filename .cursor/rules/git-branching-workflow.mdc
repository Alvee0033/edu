# Git Branching — When to Do What

Use this to **guide the user at the right moment** during the project.

## Before starting feature work
- **Check**: Is the user on a feature branch or about to start a new feature?
- **Guide**: Remind to work on a feature branch. If they haven’t switched yet:  
  `git checkout develop && git pull` then `git checkout feature/<name>` (or create `feature/<new-name>` from develop).

## While working
- **Default**: Assume work is on a feature branch. Don’t suggest merging to `main` or `develop` until the feature is done.

## When a feature or task is “done”
- **Guide**: “This feature looks complete. Merge into develop when ready:  
  `git checkout develop && git pull && git merge feature/<name> && git push origin develop`  
  or open a PR: feature branch → develop.”
- Optionally suggest deleting the feature branch after merge:  
  `git branch -d feature/<name>`.

## When they want to release / ship to production
- **Guide**: “Merge develop into main for release:  
  `git checkout main && git pull && git merge develop && git push origin main`  
  then tag: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push --tags`.”  
  Or: open a PR develop → main on GitHub.
- After release: suggest syncing develop with main:  
  `git checkout develop && git merge main && git push origin develop`.

## Hotfix (urgent production fix)
- **Guide**: Branch from `main`: `git checkout main && git pull && git checkout -b hotfix/<name>`.  
  After fix: merge to `main`, push, then merge `main` into `develop`.

## Summary
- **Starting work** → use/checkout a **feature** branch from develop.
- **Feature finished** → merge feature → **develop** (and remind them).
- **Releasing** → merge **develop** → **main**, tag, then sync **develop** with main.

Keep guidance brief; one or two sentences plus the exact commands when relevant.
