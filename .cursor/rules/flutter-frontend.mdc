# Flutter Frontend Standards
- Build UI from small, reusable widgets.
- Keep widgets pure; move logic to controllers/providers.
- Use Riverpod for state; avoid global mutable state.
- Use typed models and `freezed` for immutability.
- Separate networking layer from UI (repository pattern).
- Prefer composition over inheritance.

## Widget Structure

    atoms/
    molecules/
    organisms/
    pages/
  state/
  data/
```
